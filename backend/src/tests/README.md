# Tests TODO

- Add API tests for auth (login/register/refresh), email change, sessions, addresses, wishlist, cart, products/categories (CRUD + published listing), and orders.
- Use Jest + supertest. Include setup for test DB and cleanup between tests.
- Install dev deps when network available: `npm install --save-dev supertest`.
- Current tests are placeholders.
